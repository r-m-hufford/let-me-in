# LET-ME-IN

last updated: 09/13/23

CURRENT PHASE: 2

## Description

The purpose of this app is to practice building apis and become familiar with React and Next. I am folding in an Ember app, since that is the framework I use most.

Layout and styling are low priorities in this project. Building a solid api and exploring React and Next's toolset are high priorities.

## Phases

1. Build and API that supports authorization, authentication and use CRUD. Include a rough framework for roles and permissions.

2. Build a React app with login/logout, user CRUD and error handling.

3. Build a Next.js app with login/logout, user CRUD and error handling.

4. Build an ember app with login/logout, user CRUD and error handling.

5. Implement nice-to-haves in React and Next Apps.

6. Add some styles to the React and Next Apps.
